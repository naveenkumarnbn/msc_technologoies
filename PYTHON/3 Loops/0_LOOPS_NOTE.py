1. Using loops we can execute a BLOCK of code repeatedly

2. Python support 2 types of loops
    1. For loop    ==> for loop Iterate based on range
    2. While loop  ==> while loop Iterate based on condition


3. Loop statements
    1. break     ==> break used to terminates the loop
    2. continue  ==> continue used to skipe the current iteration
