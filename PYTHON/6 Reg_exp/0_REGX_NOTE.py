1. Using regular expressions we can find a string based on pattern.
2. Using re module we can do regular expression operations

# Regular Expression Patterns
\d  ==>  Match a digit   : [0-9]
\D  ==>  Match a nondigit: [^0-9]
\s  ==>  Match a whitespace character
\S  ==>  Match a nonwhitespace character
\w  ==>  Match a single character : [A-Za-z0-9_]
\W  ==>  Match a single nonword character: [^A-Za-z0-9_]
\n  ==>  Match a new line character

+   ==>  Matches 1 or more occurrence of preceding expression.
*   ==>  Matches 0 or more occurrence of preceding expression.
'\'   ==> Used to remove special character functionality
[]  ==>  Using square brackets "[]" Matches any single character in brackets.
{}  ==>  Matches exactly n number of occurrences of preceding expression.
